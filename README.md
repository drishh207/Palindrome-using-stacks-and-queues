# Palindrome using stacks and queues
 A more efficient way of finding palindrome 
 
 Pushing elements in stack and queue and then checking each character is an effecient method to find palindrome of a string.
 In this implmentation, LinkedList class of JDK is used to implement respective methods of stack and queue.
 Instead of LinkedList class for queue, Deque (Double ended queue) class of JDK could also be used by overriding its appropriate methods.
